# Physiotherapy | Patient Report Management System

## Overview

This project is a web-based portal designed for physiotherapists to manage patient cases and track treatment progress over time. It provides a structured way to record sessions, monitor recovery, and analyze treatment effectiveness based on measurable parameters.

The system focuses on organizing patient data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve past cases, compare treatments, and make more informed clinical decisions.

Frontend runs on:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

Backend runs on:

```
http://localhost:4000
```

## Notes

* Update `DB_PASSWORD` in `.env` if your MySQL setup uses a password
* Ensure the database name in `.env` matches exactly with the one created in phpMyAdmin
* Do not commit the `.env` file
